# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Static institutional landing site (in Spanish) for Coding Bootcamps ESPOL: promotes tech training programs, lets users browse the academic offering, learn about the institution, and request more information about a program. Redesign of an existing site, built for a "Proyecto Integrador" academic deliverable. No backend, no framework, no bundler — plain HTML5 + CSS3 + TypeScript compiled 1:1 to JS.

## Commands

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Build (compile `ts/` → `js/`): `npm run build` (runs `tsc`)
- No lint script is configured.
- No real test suite: `npm test` only runs a placeholder that exits with an error — there is nothing to execute.
- No dev server needed: open any `.html` file directly in a browser.

## Architecture

### Page structure

Six standalone HTML pages, each fully self-contained (no shared templates/includes/partials):

- `index.html` — home: hero, programs teaser grid, short "Nosotros" teaser, testimonials carousel, photo gallery + lightbox, contact form, chat widget.
- `programas.html` — full detail for the 3 programs (Full Stack Developer, Ciencia de Datos, Business Data Analytics), each with curriculum bullets and a CTA into `solicita-informacion.html` (passing `?programa=...` to preselect the program).
- `solicita-informacion.html` — lead-gen page for requesting program info. The form itself is an embedded Tally form (`data-tally-src`, via `https://tally.so/widgets/embed.js`), not a native HTML `<form>` — Tally owns validation and storage. An inline `postMessage` listener reacts to `Tally.FormLoaded`/`Tally.FormSubmitted` to fire GA4 (`gtag`) and Mixpanel events, then redirects to `gracias.html?programa=...` on submit.
- `gracias.html` — post-submission confirmation page (`noindex`, not in `sitemap.xml`), reached only via the redirect above. Reads `?programa=` to fill in confirmation copy and a prefilled `wa.me` WhatsApp link (`ts/gracias.ts`). The WhatsApp number in it is a placeholder (`593XXXXXXXXX`) that must be replaced with the real one.
- `playground.html` — component playground (unrelated to the enrollment/lead-gen flow; see its own feature branch for context).
- `404.html` — custom error page (`noindex`).

Because there is no templating system, the header/nav/footer/chat-widget markup **and** the inline `<script>` that wires up the mobile nav drawer, theme toggle, and chat widget is duplicated verbatim across all HTML files. Changing that shared behavior or markup means editing every page, not just one.

### TypeScript → JS

- Source of truth is `ts/*.ts`; the committed `js/*.js` is compiled output (`tsconfig.json`: `rootDir: ts`, `outDir: js`, target/module `ES2022`, `strict: true`). Edit the `.ts` files, never the `.js` by hand, then rerun `npm run build`.
- `ts/gracias.ts` — reads the `?programa=` query param on `gracias.html` to fill in confirmation copy and build a prefilled `wa.me` WhatsApp link.
- `ts/contacto.ts` — field validators + submit handler for the contact form on `index.html`.
- `ts/playground.ts` — supports `playground.html`'s component showcase (unrelated to the lead-gen/enrollment flow).
- `ts/animaciones.ts` — a type-guard helper (`esHTMLElement`) plus `resaltarNavActivo()`, which highlights the current page's nav link on `DOMContentLoaded` by comparing `location.pathname` to each link's `href`. No HTML page actually loads `js/animaciones.js` via `<script>`, so the whole file is still dead code in practice.
- Each compiled file is loaded via `<script defer>` only on the page(s) that need it — there's no bundler or shared module graph tying them together.

### Forms: one simulated, one real

The contact form on `index.html` is still simulated: it only validates client-side and shows an inline success message (then `form.reset()`) — no network request, backend, or email service integration.

`solicita-informacion.html` is different: its form is an embedded Tally form (external service), so submissions are real and stored by Tally, not simulated. The host page only listens for Tally's `postMessage` events to fire analytics and redirect to `gracias.html` — it does not handle validation or storage itself.

### CSS structure

Every page links only `css/styles.css`, but that file is just an `@import` aggregator (in this order): `variables.css`, `base.css`, `layout.css`, `components.css`, `responsive.css`. Add new rules to the matching partial, not to `styles.css` itself — `variables.css` for tokens, `components.css` for component styles (the largest file), `responsive.css` for media queries. `@import` order matters for cascade/specificity, so don't reorder those lines casually.

### Theming

CSS custom properties on `:root` (in `css/variables.css`) define a dark theme by default; a light variant applies either via `prefers-color-scheme: light` or a manual toggle that sets `data-theme="light"` on `<html>` and persists the choice to `localStorage`. Every page has a small blocking inline `<script>` in `<head>` that reads `localStorage` before first paint to avoid a flash of the wrong theme — keep that script in sync across pages if the theming approach ever changes.

### Known dead code

`css/layout.css` and `css/responsive.css` still define a full dropdown-nav component (`.nav-trigger`, `.dropdown`, `.nav-chevron`, `nav a.active`), and `index.html`'s inline script still wires up `.nav-trigger` listeners, but no markup on any page actually uses these classes — the nav is currently a flat link list. Don't assume there's a working submenu.

## Notes

- `PLAN.md` documents an approved iteration. Its post-enrollment confirmation page is now implemented as `gracias.html` (its dedicated "Nosotros" page is still not implemented). Note `PLAN.md` still describes the older native-`<form>`/`ts/inscripcion.ts` design for what is now `solicita-informacion.html` — treat that part of the document as historical, not current, and check the "Page structure" section above instead.
- `protecto-CB/` at the repo root is an unrelated nested git repository (its own `.git`, no `.gitmodules` entry) — it is not part of the site; `git status` will show it as a modified submodule-like entry.
- `node_modules/` is committed to the repo — the root `.gitignore` only excludes select `.claude/commands/skills/...` files, not `node_modules/` — this is pre-existing, not something to "fix" unprompted.
